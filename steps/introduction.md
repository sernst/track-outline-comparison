Track Outline Drawing Analysis
==============================

The collection of track outline drawings were imported into an image processing
program and a number of measurements were made on them with assigned 
uncertainties in the measurements:

 * Left Digit Length
 * Center Digit Length
 * Right Digit Length
 * Left-Center Splay Angle
 * Center-Right Splay Angle
 * Overall Track Width
 * Overall Track Height
 
All measurements were made pixel space, which was uniform across all samples.


Deviations
----------

For each measurement listed above, an uncertainty-weighted median was 
determined and the collection of measurements and their associated uncertainties
normalized to that median value. The result is a collection of fractional 
deviations from the median value. The median absolute deviation (MAD), which is
robust statistical measure of variance, was calculated to determine the overall
variance in the different groupings of measurements. The results are shown in
the following three plots.
